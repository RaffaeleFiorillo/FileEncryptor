# FileEncryptor
A tool that Encrypts or Decrypts files. The Encryption algorithm is custom, so it does not exist in the literature. It uses a combination of existing algorithms along with new ones.

# Notes
1. Valid Characters. Any file containing characters outside of the following list will not work and will result in an Error: 
- Letters (upper and lower case from A to Z);
- Special Characters: underscore (_), comma (,), dot (.), single quotes (');
- Numbers;
